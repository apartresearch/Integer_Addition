âœ± Understanding the underlying learning dynamics of simple tasks in Transformer networks

Understanding how a neural network does what it does would greatly improve human ability to evaluate the safety of that model. This project seeks to explain the 5 digit addition (toy) model completely, and document a generalized method for investigating a class of similar models. The project aims to add to the existing library of explained neural network circuits and help speed discovery of more circuits
